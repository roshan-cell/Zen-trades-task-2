Points taken care of:
1. The user name field only accept an email format and the validation is done through Javascript.
2. The password field is a masked field i.e. it does not reveals what the user is entering.
3. The password field does not accepts any special character other than '@' and only gets accepted when it contains an uppercase letter and a number.

Whenever any incorrect email is entered, such an alert is shown ![image](https://github.com/Bhavishaya-Bansal/Zentrades-Task3/assets/100150088/90ef7f96-05c7-4f0b-a4c6-640cc9f238ce)

Email is only accepted if it is in the valid format i.e. it must contain one '@' and one '.' indicating an email being valid.

Whenever any incorrect password is entered, such an alert is shown ![image](https://github.com/Bhavishaya-Bansal/Zentrades-Task3/assets/100150088/3776ade3-9fef-4088-a140-53131e34acb5)

In the end when email and password both are entered in correct format an alert showing 'Login Succesful!' displays. ![image](https://github.com/Bhavishaya-Bansal/Zentrades-Task3/assets/100150088/8b15280c-864c-4d8c-bdb2-297384febfa8)
